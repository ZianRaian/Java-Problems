Java: Shape 
Define the following 2 classes to represent 2-dimensional objects.

Super Class: Shape 
It should have:
1) 2 member variables: length and breadth of integer types. 
2)2 argument constructor for length and breadth which stores the arguments in their corresponding member variables.
3) A method, area(), which prints the length and breadth of shape , determined by a space. 

Concrete Class: Rectangle 
It should have:
1) 2 argument constructor for length and breadth. It should forward those arguments to the superclass constructor.
2) Override the area() method to print the area using the formula( length*breadth)

Constraints:
For both length and breadth the range should be from including 0-1000

Input format for testing: 
A single line of input consists of two space separated integers, length and breadth.

Sample Input: 
4 5 
Sample Output: 
4 5
20
